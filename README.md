Hello! I'm Francis, Software Developer and Data Scientist. I have spent most of my working time around research and data.

Recently I have been spending a lot of time building software applications in React and React Native.

Currently I am learning about TensorFlow and React Native, looking forward to mixing both to create a great mobile application.

Feel free to reach out!
